		<h2>Styles</h2>
		<p>There are many different styles of tattoos. Let me explain a few of them.</p>
		
		<h3>American Traditional</h3>
		<p>This style is based on bold, black outlines and minimal color palettes. These colors are mainly primary colors. The images used are mainly skull, roses and daggers. </p>
		
		<h3>Traditional Japanese</h3>
		<p>This style is like American Traditional where there is a lot of bold black outlines and not a lot of shading or color. Most the images in this style are inspired by traditional Japanese art and nature. Japanese folklore creatures and charters are featured a lot as well. </p>
		
		<h3>Realism</h3>
		<p>Have you ever seen a tattoo that looks so real you question it? This is that style. Unlike the traditional styles, realism doesn’t use bold outlines. Instead it uses shading and color contrast to define the image.</p>
		
		<h3>Black and Grey</h3>
		<p>This style is popular. It’s loosely based off realism but only uses black ink watered down for the different shades of grey. The only color in this style is a little white and grey for highlights. </p>
		
		<h3>Portraiture</h3>
		<p>This style is pretty much what the name says; a picture based off a portrait. The realism style is used here as well. These can be color or black and grey. </p>
		
		<h3>Illustrative</h3>
		<p>These are creative tattoos. They are a combination of traditional and realism styles. They use the bold outlines with color saturation together with realism’s shading techniques. This is done to make the tattoo look more illustrated than a tattoo. </p>
		
		<h3>New School</h3>
		<p>Illustrative meets animation to make this style. This style usually contains images that are caricatured characters doing out of character things. I guess you could say a personified character or animal in clothes doing something they wouldn’t be doing normally.</p>
		
		<h3>Biomechanical</h3>
		<p>AKA biomech, is typically a freehand style that makes it look like the body part is mechanical aesthetics. They generally follow the body flow or structure. This lead way to bio-organic which uses organisms rather than machines. </p>
		
		<h3>Neo-Traditional</h3>
		<p>This is a modern twist on American Traditional style. The bold black outlines are present but the colors and shading along with the details of realism is incorporated in this style. </p>
