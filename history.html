		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>There really isn’t a lot of documented history for tattoos. Through the research I have done, tattoos have been around since 2000 B.C. That’s a long time for them to be around. They were mainly found on Egyptian women. There are a few theories as to why the women of Egypt got tattooed. Some believe it was to show the “dancing girls” of Egypt. Others believe that because of the location of the tattoos they were to provide therapeutic role through pregnancies and to help ward off STD’s. The tools they used to tattoo are like my previously described needle wrapped in thread method. Their tools were basically a flattened needle with points connected to a stick. They would dip the tool in ink and take a small hammer to tap the ink into the skin. Honestly, I would love to have a tattoo done like this</p>
		<p>Since that tattoos have spread across the world. Tattoos have been used for many different reasons. In some cultures, they marked the criminals while others they used them to mark the spies. In New Zealand, the Maori culture tattooed their faces with elaborate tattoos to show their status. They did this because the head was considered the most important part of the body. Other cultures tattooed religious affiliations. </p>
		<p>Japan has been practicing since 5th century B.C.  They were used for beautification, magic and to mark criminals. When the lower class was restricted from wearing ornate kimonos like the royals wore, they started tattooing elaborate designs all over their body.  We know this now as tattoo body suits. Tattoos were outlawed for a while in Japan, but this just made the industry flourish. </p>
		<p>The first tattoo shop in America was opened in New York City in 1870. Traveling circuses showed rural America the art of tattoos. Most of the performers had tattoos and were considered a bizarre attraction. It’s now said that one in five Americans have a tattoo. Rather they regret it or not is another story.  </p>
