	<h2>My Tattoos</h2>
    <p>This is me on an average day. I have tattoos that show no matter what I wear. I still catch people staring from time to time, but I don’t let it bother me.  They can stare all they want… my art collection can’t be stolen or misplaced and I will take it with me when I die. Anyways, I have some random tattoos but most of them have meaning behind them.</p>
	
	<h3>Arms</h3>
	<p>Take my left hand for example. It has the quote “Loyalty Forever Reigns” tatted. I let my best friend pick out something for a matching tattoo. He has it going down his forearm though. I didn’t have the space for that so I did my hand. I have “I heart u” right above that. That one my oldest son wrote on me and I tatted it. I have a purple rosary tattooed for my mom on my left. The heart on my right arm is an Aquarius and Leo sign designed into a heart. The jesters you see on my forearms are drama masks, but I chose them because my brother that passed gave me the call handle jester. On my inner forearms, you see 2 dragon like tattoos. These were done when I first started getting tattoos and not very well. The Chinese characters are my little sisters name. There is a doll and caterpillar on my wrists. These are a version of Alice and Caterpillar from Alice in wonderland. I love that movie. Ashton is my youngest son’s name. The other names are for my best friend and her sister. The dragon wrapped around the cross is a memorial for a friend that passed when he was 15. Everyone said we looked like twins. My other upper arm is a messed of version of a cover up that I let someone start. It was never finished and I haven’t figured out what to cover it all up with yet. </p>
	
	<h3>Neck/ Chest/ Torso/ Ribs</h3>
	<p>I don’t have a lot tattooed here yet. Both the tattoos on my neck are cover ups. The rose is covering your typical white boy tattoo…. some kanji. The other is covering my poor choice in women. Didn’t get her name, but I just as well have. There is a cat that goes with the Alice from my wrist. This is Cheshire. The star is a cover up. I know you can’t make it out well but it says “Live, Laugh, Love” in it. I seen this pattern in all black and thought it’d look good in color so I tatted it the way I envisioned it. Above that is my best friend’s daughters name that passed. Yes, that is a cursive L on my stomach. A lot of my friends used to call me “L” so I got it tatted. On my rib is a prayer for my oldest son. I have yet to add my youngest son’s birthday to it. Still debating if I can find a different one for him and put it on the other side. </p>
	
	<h3>Back</h3>
	<p>Well let’s start at the neck. This is a dragon I seen and wanted it tattooed. Young and dumb. “Lorenzo” is another nickname. A friend drew them wings for an art assignment and I liked them so again I tattooed them. The dragon in the middle of my back needs finished but I like the over all design of it. That’s a portrait of my oldest son when he was almost 3 on my lower back. </p>
	
	<h3>Legs</h3>
	<p>My legs have some interesting combinations of tattoos. Above my left knee is an angel that I tattooed one night. Yes, I said I tattooed the angel on my thigh. The other is Cheshire again. Got that in Vegas with my best friend. Going down my left chin there is a Taurus sign for my oldest, Leo for me, a Pisces surrounding a Capricorn and Aquarius for a friend that lost a child. It represents her protecting them. On that foot is white rabbit from Alice in wonderland. On my right chin is a pinup girl. Another artist friend wanted to do a pinup for the first time so I volunteered. On that foot is four foot prints. 1 for each of my friends that got it tatted that night. On the outside calve is a memorial piece for my brother. He was a small engine mechanic and drove a Chevy. I took over the payments on the Chevy when he passed and when it got in an accident I put it in his tattoo as well. There is nautical stars on both my Achilles tendons.</p>
